Here's a detailed, interview-oriented **Docker notes section**, written for quick refresh with explanations, examples, and tips:

## üê≥ Docker Interview Notes

### 1. **Docker Basics**

* **What is Docker?**
  A platform for building, running, and managing containers that package code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.
* **Why Docker?**

  * Consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
  * Lightweight and fast compared to VMs.
  * Easy scaling, deployment, and isolation.

---

### 2. **Important Docker Concepts**

| Concept           | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Image**         | Blueprint for containers. Built using Dockerfile. Immutable. |
| **Container**     | A running instance of an image.                              |
| **Dockerfile**    | Script containing instructions to build a Docker image.      |
| **Docker Engine** | Core runtime for building and running containers.            |
| **Docker Hub**    | Public registry to push/pull Docker images.                  |

---

### 3. **Docker Commands**

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t myapp:latest .

# Run container
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 myapp

# List containers/images
docker ps -a
docker images

# Stop/remove
docker stop <id>
docker rm <id>
docker rmi <image_id>

# Execute inside container
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
```

---

### 4. **Dockerfile Example**

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**Notes:**

* `FROM` defines base image.
* `WORKDIR` sets working directory inside container.
* `COPY` transfers files.
* `CMD` sets default command.

---

### 5. **Docker Compose (Multi-container setup)**

* Used to manage multiple services (e.g., Flask app + PostgreSQL).
* `docker-compose.yml` example:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass
```

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Stop
docker-compose down
```

---

### 6. **Docker vs Virtual Machine**

| Docker (Container)   | Virtual Machine    |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Shares host OS       | Full OS per VM     |
| Lightweight          | Heavy              |
| Fast startup         | Slow boot time     |
| Uses fewer resources | Resource-intensive |

---

### 7. **Key Concepts**

* **Volumes**: Persistent data storage

  ```bash
  docker run -v myvolume:/data myapp
  ```
* **Networks**: Internal communication between containers

  ```yaml
  networks:
    default:
      driver: bridge
  ```
* **ENV vs ARG**:

  * `ENV` is available at runtime, `ARG` is available only during build.

---

### 8. **Container Lifecycle**

```text
Build ‚Üí Run ‚Üí Pause/Stop ‚Üí Restart ‚Üí Remove
```

* Container state can be checked with `docker inspect`, `docker logs`.

---

### 9. **Best Practices**

* Use `.dockerignore` to skip unnecessary files.
* Keep images small (use slim images).
* Use multistage builds for optimization.
* Always tag images with meaningful versions (`myapp:v1.2.0`).

---

### 10. **Common Interview Questions**

* What happens when you run `docker run`?
* Difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?
* What is the difference between exposing a port and publishing it?
* How do you persist data in Docker?
* Docker security and isolation?
* How is Docker used in CI/CD?
