Section,What Documentation Says,Script Implementation Status,Dependencies / Inputs Needed,How to Verify Manually
vCenter,- Login to :5480 UI with root or SSO- Verify NTP and DNS settings- Check Licenses- Verify VCHA (HA) status- Check vSphere HA at cluster level- Ensure each ESXi host HA state = Running/Connected,Partially Implemented- Added NTP & DNS checks- Fetch ESXi hosts- Cluster HA & licenses pending,- vCenter IP/FQDN- SSO username & password,- Login to vCenter manually → Menu → Administration → Licenses- Configure → vCenter HA- Compare with script output
ESXi Servers,- Verify hosts can go to maintenance mode- No VMs on local datastore / CD-ROM connected- Cluster capacity check- Verify host status in GreenLake Metal portal- Verify BIOS FW version- Datastore status = Normal,Partially Implemented- Fetch hosts, connection & power states- Datastore & BIOS checks pending,- vCenter IP/FQDN- GreenLake Metal portal IP/URL- GreenLake credentials,- Login to vCenter → Hosts tab- Compare connection status with script- Check BIOS FW in GreenLake portal
NSX Controller Nodes,- Web UI access check- SSH access check- Verify Management Cluster = Stable- Verify Cluster Connectivity = Up- Verify Repository Status = Sync Completed- Verify Compute Manager connectivity- Verify T0 Gateway status- Verify NSX Node Cluster Config = Success,Initial Attempt Only- /cluster/status API called, parsing failed- Other checks missing,- NSX Manager IP/FQDN- Root & admin credentials,- Login to NSX Manager Web UI → System → Overview → Appliances- Verify cluster stable & sync completed
NSX Edge Nodes,- SSH accessibility- Verify Edge Transport Node Config = Success, Node Status = Up- Verify Edge cluster mapping- Test failover of active/standby edge- Verify BGP status- Verify north-south/east-west connectivity- Verify Bridge failover, HAVIP, EVPN,Not Implemented,- NSX Manager IP/FQDN- Edge node IPs- SSH credentials,- Login to NSX Manager → System → Fabric → Edge Transport Nodes- Compare Node Status with script
HPE OneView for vCenter (OV4VC),- Login to OV4VC via Web Client- Verify login works- Verify plugin status via vCenter → Admin → Solutions → Client Plugins,Initial Attempt Only- REST API call failed to connect- JSON parsing error,- OV4VC IP/FQDN- Admin username & password,- Login to vCenter → Home → Administration → Client Plugins- Confirm HPE plugin shows Enabled
Backup NFS VM,- Verify VM accessibility via vCenter console- SSH into control plane node and check NFS share using: `mount,grep nfsshare`,Not Implemented,- vCenter IP/FQDN- Control Plane Node IPs- SSH credentials
CMP Reachability,- Cross-launch from GreenLake Central to Private Cloud Dashboard (Morpheus)- If fails, SSH to K3S master and run: curl -k --noproxy '*' https://gl-vmaas-cmplb/ping- If MORPHEUS PING → CMP OK,Not Implemented,- GreenLake tenant URL- K3S master IP- SSH credentials,- Run curl manually on K3S master- Check for MORPHEUS PING in response
